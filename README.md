This experimental project aims to improve the creation of AI-generated user interfaces. Currently, most UI language is designed for humans and can be challenging for AI to generate accurately or comprehend changes. The objective is to develop a method where users can request an AI-built interface with minimal unexpected outcomes during the process. Additionally, this approach will simplify rendering by allowing generated code to be easily displayed on-screen.
